<h3>A fire at a Mifflin Dunder distribution facility in Chicago caused extensive damage.  A high volume of product was lost in the blaze, but luckily, no one was hurt.

<h2>7/14/2009</h2>
<h3>Mifflin Dunder closed one of its longstanding manufacturing facilities.  The manufacturing facility was the original factory location that had been through many expansions throughout the years to meet the needs of the expanding paper market.<br>With the opening of two newer facilities in the last 60 years, the original factory did not have features that would allow it to expand and acquire updated modern machinery.  Tears, were shed on the day the factory was closed, as generations of Mifflin Dunder employees have worked there throughout the years.</h3>
