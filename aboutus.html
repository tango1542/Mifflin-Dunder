  In the late 1800’s, a fur trapper named Arthur Mifflin met a travelling circus performer named Helmet Dunder.  The two men went into business together when they purchased a small paper press in 1879, and together, they became Mifflin Dunder.  Within a few years, they became a bigger operation and began selling paper to local businesses.<br>
  They benefited from the Great Paper Boom of the early 1900’s, and increased their various paper product offerings.  In the 1960s, they opened three new locations.  The 1970s and 1980s saw a downturn for the paper business, but with some new direction and expanded markets, the organization stabilized and has seen steady growth ever since.<br>

  Today, Mifflin Dunder enjoys a healthy market share, selling from small to large distributors.
